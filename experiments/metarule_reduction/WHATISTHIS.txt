Experiment code modules.

- learning_curve.pl 
  > Modification of the louise/data/scripts/learning_curve/learning_curve.pl
    script to allow the configuration to be obtained from a global
    configuration module rather than the learning_curve_configuration.pl
    module. Later versions of Louise may change to make this default so that
    duplication is avoided.

- metarule_reduction.pl
  > Module with Prolog programs that implement a metarule reduction
    experiment: metarules are proressively removed and in one leg of the
    experiment, replaced with metarules learned by metarule specialisation.

- plotting/
  > Directory holding R scrips to plot results of metarule reduction
    experiments. Currently this holds the script used to plot learning curve
    experiments and should be replaced with a differet plotting script (also
    moved under scripts/ directory).
